# Customer-Feedback-Analyzer-NLP 

## Project Overview
This project leverages NLP and machine learning techniques to analyze a large dataset of food reviews from Amazon. The goal is to develop a model that extracts actionable insights from customer feedback, enabling businesses to monitor customer sentiment, identify key product attributes, and enhance decision-making processes.

## Key Features
1. Sentiment Analysis: Classifies reviews into positive and negative sentiments with 82% accuracy.
2. Topic Modeling: Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover themes and key attributes across product categories, such as taste, quality, and packaging.
3. Data Preprocessing: Employs advanced text preprocessing techniques including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal for cleaner and more structured data.
4. Scalable ML Solution: Implements the ALBERT model for sentence embeddings and a neural network classifier for sentiment detection.
## Benefits
1. Provides businesses with a comprehensive understanding of customer preferences.
2. Aids in making data-driven decisions to improve product offerings and customer satisfaction.
3. Automates customer feedback analysis, saving time and resources.
## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 500,000+ Amazon fine food reviews spanning 10 years. Key features include user details, product identifiers, ratings, and review text.
